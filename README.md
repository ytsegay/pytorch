Basic CNN on PyTorch: 
This is the first to learn pytorch hands on. This notebook does a few things:

1. load images from disk. apply transformation, resize, crop and scale
2. Demo that we can view the loaded images data
3. Build a simple CNN model that runs on GPU and CPU
4. Evaluate the model (Precision and recall metrics)
5. Load VGG and look at the outputs of the two main components. VGG contains a feature and classify layers.
6. Experiemnt with freezing some of the two layers
7. Make predictions using the two layers
